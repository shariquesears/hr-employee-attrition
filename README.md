This project was created as a part of the INSAID capstone project to help HR Advisories to detect possible employees who may end up quitting the organization. The data was sources from the HRMS where the details of all past and current employees were being for the last 15 years.

In this project the outcome is a classification where we judge if the employee is going to quit or not.
